# leaflet-challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet.js, D3.js, and JavaScript. It plots earthquake occurrences across the globe by retrieving real-time GeoJSON data from a live USGS API.

Each data point is represented as a circle, with its size proportional to the earthquake's magnitude and its color reflecting the depth at which it occurred. An interactive legend provides context for depth ranges, and popups display magnitude, depth, and location information for each event.

This challenge was completed for educational purposes. External sources, including documentation and instructional support, were referenced to correct errors and ensure accuracy. All work follows project guidelines.
